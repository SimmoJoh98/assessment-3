    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <article>
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>
            Starting from the beginning, I suppose. I've always loved games. In fact, maybe a little /too/ much. I love programming in general, however, I ultimately would like to have my own games to publish. I just don't feel like the bigger studios are passionate enough about making GAMES anymore, and are instead focused on making money.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Another main interest of mine, is video editing and production. The process to me of just making things is fun, and I enjoy it very much. Provided that I'm actually invested in what I'm doing, otherwise, I turn into a lazy uninspired machine.
        </p>
